Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset of S where
the sum of any 2 numbers in S is not evenly divisible by K .

For example, the array S = {19, 10, 12, 24,25,22} and K=4. One of the arrays
that can be created is {10,12,25}. Another is {19,22,24}. After testing all
permutations, the maximum length solution array has 3 elements.
