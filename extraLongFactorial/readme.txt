The factorial of the integer n, written n!  , is defined as:
    n! = n* n-1 * n-2 * n-3... *2
Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n=30 , we calculate and get 262528598121910558636308480000000


Constraints:
    n: an integer   1<= n <= 100

Note: Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
